# Automotive Dataset Analysis and Linear Regression

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for analyzing an automotive dataset and building a simple linear regression model to predict vehicle prices based on their characteristics.

## Objective

The objective of this notebook is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the automotive dataset and develop a predictive model using simple linear regression. The main goals include:

- Loading and inspecting the dataset
- Cleaning and preprocessing the data
- Exploring the relationships between variables through visualization and correlation analysis
- Building a simple linear regression model to predict vehicle prices
- Evaluating the performance of the regression model
- Visualizing the results and interpreting the findings

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis contains information about various attributes/features of vehicles, including their specifications and prices. It includes the following columns:

- make
- fuel_type
- aspiration
- num_of_doors
- body_style
- drive_wheels
- engine_location
- length
- width
- height
- engine_type
- num_of_cylinders
- engine_size
- compression_ratio
- horsepower
- peak_rpm
- city_mpg
- highway_mpg
- price

## Usage

To run the notebook:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook `automotive_analysis.ipynb`.
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute each cell and analyze the data.
